Overview:
This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts breast cancer using logistic regression. The model is trained on a dataset with features 
derived from digitized images of breast cancer cells. Through thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, and cross-validation, we have developed a robust
predictor to classify breast cancer cases.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before training the model, we conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset's structure, distribution, and relationships between variables. 
This step helped us understand the data's characteristics and identify potential patterns.
Preprocessing
We performed preprocessing steps to prepare the data for training. This included handling missing values, scaling numerical features, encoding categorical variables,
and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. Additionally, feature engineering techniques were applied to extract relevant information from the raw data.
Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the breast cancer predictor model was assessed using various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, Confusion matrix.
These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify breast cancer cases and its robustness across different thresholds.
Conclusion
Through rigorous analysis, preprocessing, and model development, we have created a breast cancer predictor model capable of accurately classifying breast cancer cases 
based on digitized image features. This model can potentially aid healthcare professionals in early detection and diagnosis, leading to improved patient outcomes
and treatment strategies.
